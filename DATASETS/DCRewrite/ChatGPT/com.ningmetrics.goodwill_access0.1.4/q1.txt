To refactor the `Accessor` class from using the `org.apache.log4j.Logger` to the SLF4J logging facade (`org.slf4j.Logger`), follow these key changes:

### 1. Update Imports

First, change the imports to use SLF4J instead of Log4j.

**Replace:**
```java
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
```

**With:**
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
```

### 2. Update Logger Initialization

Modify how the logger is initialized to utilize the `LoggerFactory` provided by SLF4J.

**From:**
```java
protected static final Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Accessor.class);
```

**To:**
```java
protected static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Accessor.class);
```

### Updated Class with SLF4J

Here’s how the `Accessor` class would look after refactoring to use SLF4J:

```java
package com.ning.metrics.goodwill.access;

import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

abstract class Accessor {
  protected static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(Accessor.class);
  
  protected final String host;
  protected final int port;
  protected String url;
  
  Accessor(String host, int port) {
    this.host = host;
    this.port = port;
    this.url = String.format("http://%s:%d/registrar", host, port);
  }
}
```

### Additional Notes

1. **Parameterized Logging**: If you have logging statements within your methods that construct strings, consider changing them to use SLF4J’s parameterized logging to improve performance and readability. For example:

   **From:**
   ```java
   log.info("Connecting to host: " + host + " at port: " + port);
   ```

   **To:**
   ```java
   log.info("Connecting to host: {} at port: {}", host, port);
   ```

2. **Exception Logging**: SLF4J simplifies the logging of exceptions by allowing you to pass the exception instance as the last parameter to any logging method.

By making these changes, you effectively refactor the logging in your `Accessor` class from Log4j to SLF4J, aligning with modern logging practices and making the class more adaptable to different logging frameworks backend.
