To migrate the `ImageMagickProcessorDefault` class from using the log4j library to slf4j, follow these steps:

### 1. Modify Import Statements
Replace the log4j import with slf4j imports.

**From:**
```java
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
```

**To:**
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
```

### 2. Change Logger Initialization
Update the logger initialization to use `LoggerFactory` from slf4j.

**From:**
```java
protected final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(getClass());
```

**To:**
```java
protected final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());
```

### 3. Update Logging Methods
Adjust the logging statements to use slf4j's logging format with `{}` placeholders for variables.

**Change debug logs:**
From:
```java
this.logger.debug(command);
```
To:
```java
this.logger.debug("Command executed: {}", command);
```

**Change error logs:**
From:
```java
this.logger.error("Error while resizing image: " + command, e);
```
To:
```java
this.logger.error("Error while resizing image: {}", command, e);
```

These adjustments ensure you're using slf4j's more efficient string handling and maintain consistency in how exceptions are logged across different logging frameworks. The use of placeholders (`{}`) avoids unnecessary string concatenation before the method is called, which is especially beneficial if the logging level is such that the message would not be logged. 

This migration will make the code cleaner and more maintainable, aligning with modern Java practices and potentially easing integration with other systems and frameworks that use slf4j.
