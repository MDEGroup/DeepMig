To migrate the `FFmpeg` class from using the log4j library to slf4j, you need to adjust the import statements, modify how the logger is initialized, and update any logging methods used in the class. Here's a concise outline of the code changes required:

### 1. Modify Import Statements
Change the logger import from log4j to slf4j.

**From:**
```java
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
```

**To:**
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
```

### 2. Change Logger Initialization
Switch the logger initialization to use `LoggerFactory` from slf4j.

**From:**
```java
protected static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(FFmpeg.class);
```

**To:**
```java
protected static final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FFmpeg.class);
```

### 3. Update Logging Methods
If there are any logging statements in the class, update them to use the slf4j syntax with `{}` placeholders for variable data.

**Before (Example):**
```java
logger.info("FFmpeg full version: " + avail.fullVersion);
logger.info("FFmpeg is not available");
```

**After (Example):**
```java
logger.info("FFmpeg full version: {}", avail.fullVersion);
logger.info("FFmpeg is not available");
```

These modifications are straightforward as slf4j syntax and log4j are quite similar for basic logging tasks. Hereâ€™s how it looks in your logging cases:

- The slf4j logger directly supports logging exceptions alongside messages without the need for additional formatting changes.
- The `{}` placeholder efficiently concatenates strings without the overhead of string concatenation in Java, which can be more performance efficient especially in loops or large-scale applications.

### Applying the Changes
These changes make the class compatible with slf4j, providing a more modern and flexible logging solution. Test the class after making these changes to confirm that all functionalities work as expected without any runtime issues. This also ensures that the logging outputs are correct and useful for debugging and monitoring the application's behavior.
