To migrate the `CacheableRequestPolicy` class from Log4j to SLF4J, you'll need to update the import statements and modify how the Logger is initialized. Here are the specific changes:

1. **Change the Logger Import:**
   Update the import statements at the beginning of your Java class to switch from Log4j to SLF4J.

   Replace:
   ```java
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Update Logger Initialization:**
   Change how the Logger instance is created to use SLF4J's `LoggerFactory`.

   Replace:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(getClass());
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());
   ```

These changes adapt the class to use SLF4J, which is a simpler facade for various logging frameworks and allows more flexibility in changing or configuring the underlying logging system. Make sure that SLF4J and its corresponding binding to an underlying logging framework implementation are correctly set up in your project's dependencies.
