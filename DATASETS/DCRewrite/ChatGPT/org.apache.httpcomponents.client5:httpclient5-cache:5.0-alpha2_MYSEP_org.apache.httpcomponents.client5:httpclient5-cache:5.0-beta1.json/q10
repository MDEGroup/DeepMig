To migrate the `CachedResponseSuitabilityChecker` class from using Log4j to SLF4J, you need to update the import statements and modify how the logger is initialized. Here’s how you can make these changes:

1. **Update Import Statements:**
   Replace the Log4j import statements with SLF4J equivalents.

   Change:
   ```java
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   To:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Modify Logger Initialization:**
   Update the instantiation of the logger to use SLF4J’s `LoggerFactory`.

   Change:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(getClass());
   ```
   To:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());
   ```

These modifications will switch the logging framework from Log4j to SLF4J for the `CachedResponseSuitabilityChecker` class. Make sure SLF4J and its necessary binding to a logging backend (like Logback or a bridge to another logging framework such as Log4j 2) are included in your project dependencies. This approach not only maintains your logging capabilities but also adds flexibility for potentially swapping the logging implementation in the future without further code changes.
