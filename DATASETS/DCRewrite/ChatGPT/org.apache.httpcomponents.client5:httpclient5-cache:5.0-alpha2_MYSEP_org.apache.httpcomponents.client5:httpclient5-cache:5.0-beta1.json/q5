To update the `ResponseCachingPolicy` class from using Log4j to SLF4J, here are the specific changes you need to make:

1. **Change the Logger Import**:
   Update the import statements at the beginning of your Java class to import SLF4J classes instead of Log4j classes.

   Replace:
   ```java
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Update Logger Initialization**:
   Modify the instantiation of the logger object to use SLF4J's `LoggerFactory` instead of Log4j's `LogManager`.

   Replace:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(getClass());
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());
   ```

These changes will convert the logging system in the `ResponseCachingPolicy` class from Log4j to SLF4J, facilitating easier control over logging dependencies and potentially simplifying the integration with different logging frameworks in the future. Ensure you have the SLF4J API and an appropriate binding in your project dependencies to enable this functionality.
