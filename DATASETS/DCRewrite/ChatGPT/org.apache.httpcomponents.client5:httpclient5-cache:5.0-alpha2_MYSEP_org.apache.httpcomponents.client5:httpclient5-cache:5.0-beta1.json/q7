To migrate the `AsynchronousValidationRequest` class from using Log4j to SLF4J, you will need to make changes to the import statements and the way the logger is initialized. Here's how to do it:

1. **Update Import Statements:**
   Change the imports related to logging to use SLF4J classes instead of Log4j classes.

   Replace:
   ```java
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Change Logger Initialization:**
   Modify how the Logger instance is created to use SLF4J's `LoggerFactory`.

   Replace:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(getClass());
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());
   ```

These modifications will switch the logging framework from Log4j to SLF4J, making your class compatible with SLF4J's logging facade. Ensure that SLF4J and its bindings to an actual logging implementation (like Logback or an SLF4J binding to Log4j2) are correctly included in your project dependencies. This will allow you to control logging behavior through SLF4J, which can route logging calls to a concrete logging framework of your choice.
