To update the `AsynchronousValidator` class from using Log4j to SLF4J, follow these steps to adjust the logger initialization and import statements:

1. **Change the Logger Import**:
   Replace the Log4j import with the SLF4J equivalent.

   Replace:
   ```java
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;
   import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Update Logger Initialization**:
   Modify how the logger is instantiated to use SLF4J's LoggerFactory.

   Replace:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(getClass());
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   private final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(getClass());
   ```

By applying these changes, you switch from the direct dependency on Log4j to using the SLF4J facade, which allows for more flexible logging backend management and makes your application's logging setup more adaptable and easier to maintain.

Make sure you have the SLF4J API and a corresponding binding (like SLF4J-Log4j2 binding if you want to keep using Log4j 2.x as the underlying logger, or any other SLF4J-compatible log framework) in your project dependencies to enable logging functionality.
