To transition the `SecurityNegotiationStage` class from using Log4j to SLF4J, follow these steps to update the logging implementation:

1. **Change the Logger Import:**
   Replace the Log4j import statement with the SLF4J import.
   ```java
   import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   Change to:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Modify Logger Instantiation:**
   Update the instantiation of the logger to use SLF4J's LoggerFactory.
   ```java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(SecurityNegotiationStage.class);
   ```
   Change to:
   ```java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SecurityNegotiationStage.class);
   ```

3. **Refactor Debug and Error Logging:**
   If you have any debug or error log statements that concatenate strings, consider using parameterized logging to improve performance and readability.
   
   For example, if you had:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("request key value pairs:\n" + sb.toString());
   ```
   It should be changed to:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("request key value pairs:\n{}", sb.toString());
   ```

   Similarly, update error logging to include exception logging directly:
   ```java
   LOGGER.error("initiator attempted CHAP authentication");
   ```
   If there was an exception to log alongside the message:
   ```java
   LOGGER.error("Error processing request", e);
   ```

4. **Update Logging Statements Using Conditions:**
   If conditions check whether logging at a certain level is enabled (common in Log4j to avoid unnecessary string concatenation costs), these can typically be removed unless performance profiling indicates it's necessary. SLF4J supports parameterized messages which reduce the overhead of message construction:

   Instead of:
   ```java
   if (LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {
       LOGGER.debug("Login Phase successful");
   }
   ```
   You could simply use:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("Login Phase successful");
   ```

These changes will convert your class to use SLF4J, which is more flexible and modern compared to Log4j, especially when it comes to managing different logging frameworks and cleaner logging code practices.
