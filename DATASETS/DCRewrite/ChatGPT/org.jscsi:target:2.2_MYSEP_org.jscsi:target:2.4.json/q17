To migrate the `ReadCapacityStage` class from using Log4j to SLF4J, you should make the following changes:

1. **Change the Import Statements**:
   Replace the Log4j import with the SLF4J imports.

   Change this:
   ```java
   import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   To this:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Modify Logger Initialization**:
   Update the instantiation of the logger object to use SLF4J's `LoggerFactory`.

   Change from:
   ```java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(ReadCapacityStage.class);
   ```
   To:
   ```java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ReadCapacityStage.class);
   ```

3. **Adjust Logging Calls**:
   If there are logging calls that perform string concatenation or that use conditions to check log levels, consider changing them to use parameterized messages. This is a feature of SLF4J that can improve performance by avoiding string concatenation when the log level is not enabled.

   For example, if you had a logging call that looked like this:
   ```java
   LOGGER.error("encountered " + cdb.getClass() + " in ReadCapacityStage with " +
                "LOGICAL BLOCK ADDRESS = " + cdb.getLogicalBlockAddress());
   ```
   Change it to:
   ```java
   LOGGER.error("encountered {} in ReadCapacityStage with LOGICAL BLOCK ADDRESS = {}", 
                cdb.getClass(), cdb.getLogicalBlockAddress());
   ```

These steps convert the logging system in your class from Log4j to SLF4J, making it more flexible and better suited for modern Java projects, with improved performance due to SLF4J's advanced message formatting capabilities.
