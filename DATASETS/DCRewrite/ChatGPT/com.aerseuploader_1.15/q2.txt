To transition the `UploaderToFile` class from using the `log4j` logging framework to `slf4j`, you'll need to make a few systematic changes:

### 1. Change Logger Import
First, switch the logger import from `log4j` to `slf4j`.

**From:**
```java
import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
```

**To:**
```java
import org.slf4j.Logger;
import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
```

### 2. Update Logger Initialization
Modify how the logger instance is created to utilize `slf4j`'s `LoggerFactory`.

**From:**
```java
private static final Logger LOG = Logger.getLogger(UploaderToFile.class);
```

**To:**
```java
private static final Logger LOG = LoggerFactory.getLogger(UploaderToFile.class);
```

### 3. Adjust Logging Methodology
Ensure all logging calls are updated to utilize `slf4j`'s placeholder syntax for better performance and clarity.

#### Example Conversion:
Here's an example of updating logging statements to use `slf4j`'s parameterized messages:

**Before:**
```java
LOG.info("listing: " + req);
LOG.error("unable to delete directory: " + newPath.getAbsolutePath(), e);
```

**After:**
```java
LOG.info("listing: {}", req);
LOG.error("unable to delete directory: {}", newPath.getAbsolutePath(), e);
```

### 4. Review and Test
After these changes, you should:
- Ensure that no instances of string concatenation remain in the logging calls.
- Check for and resolve any issues related to logging that might affect the readability or performance of the log statements.
- Thoroughly test the class to confirm that logging behaves as expected without any errors or misconfigurations.

These changes not only modernize the logging approach but also enhance the efficiency of how logging is processed in the application, leveraging `slf4j`'s capabilities for deferred execution of logging messages.
