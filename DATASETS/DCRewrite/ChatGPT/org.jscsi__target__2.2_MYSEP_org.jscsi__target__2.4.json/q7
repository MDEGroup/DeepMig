To migrate the `TextNegotiationStage` class from using Log4j to SLF4J, you'll need to make the following changes:

1. **Update Import Statements:**
   Replace the Log4j import with the SLF4J import.
   ```java
   import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   Change to:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Change Logger Instantiation:**
   Modify how the logger is instantiated to use SLF4J's `LoggerFactory`.
   ```java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(TextNegotiationStage.class);
   ```
   Should be updated to:
   ```java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TextNegotiationStage.class);
   ```

3. **Adjust Logging Statements:**
   Update logging statements to use SLF4J's parameterized logging where applicable. This avoids unnecessary string concatenation when logging is disabled for the respective level.

   For example, replace:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("text request: " + textRequest);
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("text request: {}", textRequest);
   ```

   And:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("text negotiation stage reply: " + replyString);
   ```
   With:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("text negotiation stage reply: {}", replyString);
   ```

   Ensure that if any logging statements involve exceptions, the exception is passed as a separate parameter to allow for better exception handling and logging:
   ```java
   LOGGER.error("Error message here", e);
   ```

4. **Remove Unnecessary Logging Condition Checks:**
   If there are conditions checking whether a specific log level is enabled (common with Log4j to avoid constructing complex messages unnecessarily), these can typically be removed because SLF4J's parameterized logging inherently handles this:

   Instead of:
   ```java
   if (LOGGER.isDebugEnabled()) {
       LOGGER.debug("Some debug message");
   }
   ```
   You can simply use:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("Some debug message");
   ```

These changes will ensure that your class uses SLF4J for logging, which can help with consistency across your application and improve performance due to the reduced string concatenation.
