To migrate the `TargetSenderWorker` class from Log4j to the SLF4J logging framework, follow these steps:

1. **Change the Import Statement**:
   Replace the import for Log4j with the imports for SLF4J.

   Change from:
   ```java
   import org.apache.log4j.Logger;
   ```
   Change to:
   ```java
   import org.slf4j.Logger;
   import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;
   ```

2. **Modify Logger Initialization**:
   Update the instantiation of the logger object to use SLF4J's `LoggerFactory`.

   Change from:
   ```java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = Logger.getLogger(TargetSenderWorker.class);
   ```
   Change to:
   ```java
   private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(TargetSenderWorker.class);
   ```

3. **Adjust Logging Calls (if necessary)**:
   SLF4J supports parameterized messages, which can improve performance by avoiding string concatenation when the log level is not enabled. Consider modifying the logging calls to utilize this feature.

   For example, if you have:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("CDB bytes: \n" + Debug.byteBufferToString(parser.getCDB()));
   ```
   You can change it to:
   ```java
   LOGGER.debug("CDB bytes: \n{}", Debug.byteBufferToString(parser.getCDB()));
   ```

These changes ensure that `TargetSenderWorker` utilizes the SLF4J framework, providing more flexibility for managing logging dependencies and potentially improving performance due to parameterized logging.
